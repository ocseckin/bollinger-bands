Bollinger Bands
-----------------
A Bollinger Band is used as a technical anaylsis tool taking into account the prices and volatility over time of a financial instrument or
commodity. Altough the bands are usually built by adding two standard deviations (positively and negatively) to a simple moving average of
the security's price, these can be adjusted to user preferences.

Bollinger Bands were developed and copyrighted by John Bollinger in the 1980s.

In the codes, we will plot those bands and will define two different functions for to automatise the Bollinger Band making process:

  1. In the "Bollinger Bands" it will be simply the Bollinger Bands that we will be looking for.
  
  2. "Bollinger Decision Maker" is a little bit fancier, we will be analyzing how many times Bollinger Bands were right to say that 
there is a need to take an action. Moreover, we will illustrate these moments where the prices are above or below bands and make a "heat 
map" out of them.
